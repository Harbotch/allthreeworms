# Project Developing Python Code Creating a *Self-Replicating Worm* to Traverse Network.

**This project is developed by John Nostran, Nick Judson, & Casey McQuilliams.** It is our final project for our participation in *University of San Diego & Fullstack Academy's Cyber Security* bootcamp immersive study program.

Our project required us to create a **self-replicating worm using python coding**,  The worm needed to not just identify hosts on our known network subnet, but also to identify other subnets and continue to replicate on-and-on.  

**Scope:**  Inasmuch as we are not trying ton infect the globe with an actual worm, we used **kali linux** and (2) **ubuntu mini** machines on our virtual box, but set network settings to host-only adapters.  Not only did this prevent nefarious activity, but our code is fairly simplified and does not attempt to traverse firewalls, ACL's, or other IDS and IPS protocols.  

**Our code does, however, demonstrate the use of nmap & the python-nmap module, paramiko & the paramiko module, and logical python coding techniques for creating lists and accessing/using these lists to our advantage, as well as transferring files form the host machine to the victim machine and insstructing the victim machine to execute the code in the file.**

We drank plenty of :coffee: :coffee: :coffee: during the research portion of this project.
